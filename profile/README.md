Yo-ho, Flint Crew, hoist the data high,  
From ASKAP's gaze to the boundless sky!  
With pipelines run and code so keen,  
We'll chart the gas that's rarely seen!

Out on the plains where the dishes stand,  
ASKAP scans across the land,  
Tracing hydrogen, far and near,  
Galactic whispers sharp and clear.

FFT and flagging true,  
Calibrate with gains anew,  
Clean the vis, stack the cubes,  
Map the gas with spectral hues!

We'll chart the gas that's rarely seen!

Phased arrays in perfect rows,  
Beamformers catch what the cosmos throws,  
Neutral hydrogen, vast and grand,  
Tracing structures across the land.

Python scripts with logic bright,  
Processing data through day and night,  
Flag the RFI, smooth the plot,  
Reveal the signals we have sought!

With pipelines run and code so keen,  
We'll chart the gas that's rarely seen!

Through cosmic webs and filaments vast,  
HI signals from the ages past,  
Stack the cubes, feather light,  
Reveal the universe in radio sight!

From ASKAP's gaze to the boundless sky!  
With pipelines run and code so keen,  
We'll chart the gas that's rarely seen!
